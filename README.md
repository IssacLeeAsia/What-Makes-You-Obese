# What-Makes-You-Obese

This project is the capstone project of the course DS-GA â€“ 1001 Introduction to Data Science. I was in collaboration with I-Chen Kuo (ik2437@nyu.edu) in this program. I was responsible for Part I in this notebook file and wrote the report. The data we use is the [estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+).
